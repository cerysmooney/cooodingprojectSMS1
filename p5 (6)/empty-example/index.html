  <p>This is my animated sketch. Going along with my bee theme,
     I decided to create "honeycombs" which are really
    just hexagons going down the screen with flashing different shades of yellow. The hexagons are also spinning
    at random times and places. This sketch was
    to create the scenario of honey dripping down the screen, and  let the viewer seem like they
    are in a beehive.I also added a yellow gradient background, going from light to dark, to add more of an effect.
